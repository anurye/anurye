I am a Systems Engineer at [Northvolt](https://northvolt.com/), working on battery management system (BMS) algorithms. Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Robotics at [Warsaw University of Technology](https://eng.pw.edu.pl/) in October 2024, where I worked on mobile robot navigation in dynamic environments using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) under the supervision of Prof. Elżbieta Jarzębowska. Prior to that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Addis Ababa Science and Technology University](http://www.aastu.edu.et/) in September 2021. My primary research interest is in safe human-robot interaction (HRI).

**Research Interests:** With the growing presence of robots in human environments, ensuring safe and natural interaction with humans is critical. My research focuses on:

- Developing generalizable frameworks for modeling and predicting human behavior in dynamic, everyday environments.
- Addressing challenges in safe human-robot interaction (HRI), especially in scenarios where training data is limited.
- Investigating the use of techniques like inverse reinforcement learning to improve robots' ability to anticipate human actions and respond to subtle behavioral cues.
